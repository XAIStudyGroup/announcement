## Welcome to the Explainable AI Study Group at iSchool, UIUC

Explainable AI study group aims to create a low-pressure, peer-mentoring learning space for students to get together and learn explainable AI (XAI) techniques. We exercise Feynmann's method of learning (i.e., learning by teaching) in this group. For each session, one instructor will walk the audience through an example of an explainable AI method. Unlike conventional reading groups, this group emphasizes hands-on learning. And learners do not need to prepare before the sessions. We will "open our doors" in **Spring 2022**. You are welcome to "watch" this repository for any updates.

## Sessions

- [Malik Salami](https://ischool.illinois.edu/people/malik-salami): Explain Linear Regression Model and [Yuanxi Fu](https://ischool.illinois.edu/people/yuanxi-fu): Explain Logistic Regression Model (Feb 12, 2022) [**Registration**](https://illinois.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZ0oceirrzkjE9Bih4Cye6H1KvWVhbNUFIZk)
- TBD: Explain Decision Tree Model (Feb 26, 2022) [**Registration**](https://illinois.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZMkdO-rpjIoGtP6ju6PSOp7DRLmgQbtkxST)
- One more advanced XAI technique (TBD)(Mar 5, 2022 or TBD after the spring break)

## Prerequisite  
To attend our sessions, you only need to have two types of IDEs (Integrated programming environment) installed on your computer and know how to use them. One for R and one for Python, since we allow instructors to choose which language they want to code their examples in.

## Instructors  
Since this is a peer-mentoring learning space, we do not hold instructors to the same high standard for a real classroom. Your main job is to share your working example of one XAI method, coded in R or Python, and explain how you did it, what problems you encountered, and other lessons learned along the way. We welcome any upper-level undergraduate students, master's students, and PhD students to try on the role of instructors.
