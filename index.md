## Welcome to Explainable AI Study Group at iSchool, UIUC

Explainable AI study group aims to create a low-pressure, peer-mentoring learning space for students to get together and learn explainable AI techniques. For each session, one instructor will walk the audience through an example of an explainable AI method. Unlike conventional reading groups, this group emphasizes hands-on learning. And learners do not need to prepare before the sessions. We are in the process of learning-module development. We expect to “open our door” to learners in **Spring 2022**. Projected sessions include:

- [Malik Salami](https://ischool.illinois.edu/people/malik-salami): Explain Linear Regression Model
- [Yuanxi Fu](https://ischool.illinois.edu/people/yuanxi-fu): Explain Logistic Regression Model
- [Jaihyun Park](https://ischool.illinois.edu/people/jaihyun-park): Explain Decision Tree Model
