## Welcome to the Explainable AI Study Group at iSchool, UIUC

Explainable AI study group aims to create a low-pressure, peer-mentoring learning space for students to learn and practice explainable AI (XAI) techniques. For each session, one instructor will walk the audience through a working example of an explainable AI method. Unlike conventional reading groups, this group emphasizes hands-on learning. And learners do not need to prepare before the sessions. We will "open our doors" in **Spring 2022**. You are welcome to "watch" this repository for any updates.

## Sessions
- [Yuanxi Fu](https://ischool.illinois.edu/people/yuanxi-fu): Overview of Interpretability (Jan 29, 2022) [**Registration**](https://illinois.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZcvdO2orT0pEtcaJjnNYbVH8oamISt4gCVR)
- [Malik Salami](https://ischool.illinois.edu/people/malik-salami): Explain Linear Regression Model and [Yuanxi Fu](https://ischool.illinois.edu/people/yuanxi-fu): Explain Logistic Regression Model (Feb 12, 2022) [**Registration**](https://illinois.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZ0oceirrzkjE9Bih4Cye6H1KvWVhbNUFIZk)
- TBD: Explain Decision Tree Model (Feb 26, 2022) [**Registration**](https://illinois.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZMkdO-rpjIoGtP6ju6PSOp7DRLmgQbtkxST)
- One more advanced XAI technique (TBD)(Mar 5, 2022 or TBD after the spring break)

## Prerequisite  
To attend our sessions, you only need to have two types of IDEs (Integrated programming environment) installed on your computer and know how to use them. One for R and one for Python, since we allow instructors to choose which language they want to code their examples in. No prior experience in ML is needed, but having it is a plus.

## Instructors  
Since this is a peer-mentoring learning space, we do not hold instructors to the same high standard for a real classroom. You can choose a method, code a working example of using this method to explain your machine learning or deep learning model, and show how you do it to the audience. We will post videos of sample teaching in the future. 

We welcome any upper-level undergraduate students, master's students, and PhD students to try on the role of instructors. Develop your code on your own and let me know when the repository is ready to be forked.

## Q&A
### What is the end goal of this study group? 
1. Learn techniques to explain your machine learning model
2. Horn your teaching skills if you decide to be an instructor
3. Help each other to learn and make friends

### What skills will I gain?  
As a learner, you will learn techniques that can be used to explain your own machine learning or deep learning models. As an instructor, you learn teaching skills, curriculum development skills, and the experience of working with a diverse group of learners. 

### What is the format of this study group?
For each session, one instructor will walk the audience through a working example of an explainable AI method (see the list here). The audience can code along or just watch how the instructor does it.
