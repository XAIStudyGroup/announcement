## Welcome to the Explainable AI Study Group at iSchool, UIUC

Explainable AI study group aims to create a low-pressure, peer-mentoring learning space for students to get together and learn explainable AI (XAI) techniques. For each session, one instructor will walk the audience through an example of an explainable AI method. Unlike conventional reading groups, this group emphasizes hands-on learning. And learners do not need to prepare before the sessions. We are in the process of learning-module development. We expect to “open our door” to learners in **Spring 2022**. Projected sessions include:

- [Yuanxi Fu](https://ischool.illinois.edu/people/yuanxi-fu): Overview of Interpretability
- [Malik Salami](https://ischool.illinois.edu/people/malik-salami): Explain Linear Regression Model and [Yuanxi Fu](https://ischool.illinois.edu/people/yuanxi-fu): Explain Logistic Regression Model
- [Jaihyun Park](https://ischool.illinois.edu/people/jaihyun-park): Explain Decision Tree Model
- One more advanced XAI technique (TBD)
